                Hello there! my name is Viona and I graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in
                Digital Information
                Technology specialising in UI/UX and Welcome to my portfolio! I am a young UI/UX designer on a constant
                journey of learning and
                growth. As a lifelong learner, I love exploring the many ideas of user-centric design and leveraging the
                power of interesting UI
                design tools to create intuitive and delightful experiences.

            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
                Throughout my educational endeavors, I have cultivated a strong foundation in design principles, user
                research, and prototyping
                techniques. After I've graduated, I went on to take a google certificate course on User Experience to
                optimise my design process
                and adapt to quick brainstorming wireframe ideas.

            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
                In my portfolio, you will find a collection of personal works and academic projects in which I would showcase my design
                process, projects ranging
                from website design to banners and icon designs. So, come on in and explore my work. Join me on this
                exciting adventure as I embark
                on a relentless pursuit of creating impactful and memorable experiences through the ever-evolving world
                of UI/UX design!

                <p>
                   After being exposed to many different design frameworks, I have adopted a design process that helps me facilitate my work.
                   I would start off with a user research phase where I could find user challenges and empathise with the users to understand their
                   needs in which afterwards I am able to define a problem statement. From then on, I would work on brainstorming many ideas with respect
                   to the problem statement. With a choosen idea, I can work on the wireframing phase. generating drafts of wireframes and choosing 
                   the best elements to include into the final version. After validating the designs, I with turn them into a mock up and create a prototype
                   out of it. Finally I would use the prototype to conduct a user testing to gather feedbacks, check the usability rate and for further 
                   improvements to the prototype.
