                    crafTy is an app dedicated to craft supply shopping, serves as a haven for customers seeking
                    distinctive and high-quality supplies for their artistic endeavors. The primary focus is on catering
                    to the needs of passionate artists and craft enthusiast.

                <h3 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">The problem and goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Artists and craft enthusiast needed accessibility to unique craft supplies. As such I thought why
                    not create a craft supply shopping app that allow users to source for unique craft supplies
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12">
                <h3 class="title" style="text-align: center;text-decoration: underline 5px;text-underline-offset: 10px;">User research</h3>
                <h4 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">User Interview</h4>
                <p>Based on the problem and goal, I jot down some key questions for my user interview:</p>
                <div class="overflow-auto"><img src="images/prog7-1.jpg" alt="user research questions" style="max-width: 60em; height: auto;"></div>
                <p> 
                    and with that I gathered 5 user interview results from friends and family and group them based on similar
                    answers and identify their pain points.<br><br>
                    One key user segment that emerged from the research comprises busy artists who struggles to find
                    craft supplies that meet their specific requirements and standards. Another key user segment would
                    be educational teachers who are looking out for new and exciting craft supplies that are available
                    for a wide range of age levels.
                    Additionally, the many factors that hindered them from looking for high-quality craft supplies such
                    as personal commitments, budget, or difficulties associated with acquiring supplies in-store.

                <h4 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Pain Points</h4>
                <p>With the given factors contributing to the research problem, I have gathered a few pain points from

                <p>
                    In order to kickstart my wireframe design, I did an analysis on competitors that have the same
                    target audience and were solving the same problem statement.
                    Here's are the key competitors and possible gaps within their products:

                    <h3 class="title">Sitemap</h3>
                    <p>Based on the journey map, I constructed a basic sitemap so I could get a clearer idea on how the users would navigate within the app as well as the structure of information</p>
                    <div class="overflow-auto"><img src="images/crafty_sitemap.jpg" alt="pain point"  style="max-width: 60em; height: auto;"></div>
                <h3 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Low-Fidelity Wireframe</h3>
                <p>
                    To start off my design, I draft out multiple iterations of paper wireframes for each screen. Then
                    based on the persona and sitemap,
                    I choose the most important elements from from among the various drafted wireframes that meet the
                    needs of the user and created the first
                    version of each screen to be transformed into digital low-fidelity wireframes and prototype.
                </p>
                <div class="overflow-hidden"><img src="images/paper_wireframe.jpg" alt="pain point"  style="max-width: 60em; height: auto;"></div>
                <p>
                    These would be the first version of the crafTy app's wireframes, choosing a simple navigation layout
                    such that users can access different areas of the app easily:

                <h3 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Usability Testing and Finding</h3>
                <p>
                    With the low-fidelity prototype, I decided to conduct the first usability testing to gather some
                    feedbacks from my friends and family to improve
                    the user experience and needs. The prototype showcases the main flow of the app which is purchasing
                    a craft supply.
                </p>
                <p>These are the tasks and question that the users had to complete during the testing:</p>
                <span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">1</span>
                Search for a craft supply using the search bar
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">2</span>
                Search for a craft supply using the filter option and filter by price
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">3</span>
                would you prefer to search using a search bar or using a filter option?
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">4</span>
                view a craft supply
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">5</span>
                Proceed to purchase the craft supply
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">6</span>
                Confirm your order and complete the payment process

                <p style="margin-top: 35px;">After the user testing, I retrieved all the answers from the interview
                    notes and subsequently categorising them based on the app's features and grouping together those
                    that exhibited similar responses.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 35px;">By analysing all the responses, here are my finding to help improve the
                    crafTy app:</p>

                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large;">1</span>
                    Users want ability to select variations of a product

                    Users want a way to add payment details before the payment process
                <br><span
                style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">3</span>
                Users need better indication when the search results are loaded
                <br><span
                style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">4</span>
                Users need more filtering options to enhance their search results
                <br><span
                style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#845EC2;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">5</span>
                Users wants courier option for safer purchase experience
                <br><span

                The filter options and button names lack clarity, causing user confusion.

                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">By providing and improving on the filter feature, it gives users more control over their
                            product searches.
                            In addition, choosing an easy navigation layout within the app helps them to navigate

                                It a good habit to iterate on each screen multiple times as you need. With each iterations,
                            the design get betters with users' needs in mind.
                            It is also important to consider the accessibility for users with different range of
                            abilities (e.g. one arm, visual impairment)
