                        Delightful Bakery is a neighborhood bakery that offers a wide variety of freshly baked goods and customisable cake service. 
                        The bulking ordering website is created to help customers to have an easy ordering process and to keep track of their orders.

                <p>
                    Frequent customers of Delightful Bakery have stressful moments while performing bulk orders. Designing a bulk ordering website such that users can have easy access to ordering and coordinating their orders.

                <h3 class="title" style="text-align: center;text-decoration: underline 5px;text-underline-offset: 10px;">User research</h3>
                <h4 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">User Interview</h4>
                <p>
                    Prior to the user interview, I prepare a few questions that are linked to the problem and goal statement:
                   <div style="background-color: #954A05; padding: 10px; width: fit-content; border-radius: 10px;  color: #fff;">
                        <ol>
                            <li>How often do you frequent the bakery?</li>
                            <li>What do you dislike about ordering from this bakery and how does it make you feel?</li>
                            <li>Usually on what occasions will you order in bulk?</li>
                            <li>Why did you choose to buy from the bakery?</li>
                            <li>What are some of the challenges you face while ordering in bulk?</li>
                        </ol>
                   </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sent these questions into an AI to help me generate 5 user interview scripts and subsequently group them based on similar
                    answers and identify their pain points.<br><br>
                    One key user segment that emerged from the research comprises frequent customers of delightful bakery who struggles to coordinate pick-ups and delivery for their orders. 
                    Various challenges such as picking an available date and time from their schedule, traffic considerations and the bakery's ability to complete the order prevents users from coordinating 
                    the pick-ups and delivery at ease.
                </p>
                <h4 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Pain Points</h4>
                <p>With the given factors contributing to the research problem, I have gathered a few pain points from
                    the interview script:</p>
                <div class="row" style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

                            style="width: 5em;"><br>
                        <h4>Accessibility to baked goods</h4><br>certain baked products are sold out quickly when they arrive at the bakery
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-4" style=" text-align: center;padding: 30px;"><img src="images/pen2.png" alt="pain point"
                            style="width: 5em;"><br>
                        <h4>Plan time and date constraints</h4><br>When ordering in bulk, they have to consider traffic conditions, date and time of the occasion, making coordination difficult
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-4" style=" text-align: center;padding: 30px;"><img src="images/pen3.png" alt="pain point"
                            style="width: 5em;"><br>
                        <h4>Slow cake customisation service</h4><br>From discussing the design with the bakery to deciding on the date can be very time consuming

                <p>
                    In order to kickstart my wireframe design, I did an analysis on competitors that have the same
                    target audience and were solving the same problem statement.
                    Here's are the key competitors and possible gaps within their products:

                    <h3 class="title">Sitemap</h3>
                    <p>Based on the journey map, I constructed a basic sitemap so I could get a clearer idea on how the users would navigate within the app as well as the structure of information</p>
                    <div class="overflow-auto"><img src="images/db_sitemap.jpg" alt="pain point" style="width: 75em;"></div>
                <h3 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Low-Fidelity Wireframe</h3>
                <p>
                    To start off my design, I draft out multiple iterations of paper wireframes for each screen. Then
                    based on the persona,sitemap and drawing inspriration from our competitors.
                    I choose the most important elements from from among the various drafted wireframes that meet the
                    needs of the user and created the first
                    version of each screen to be transformed into digital low-fidelity wireframes and prototype.
                </p>
                <div class="overflow-hidden"><img src="images/paper_wireframedb.jpg" alt="pain point" style="width: 75em; padding-bottom: 30px;"></div>
                <p>
                    These would be the first version of the Delightful bakery website's wireframes, adopting the z-layout to present the content, for example, the homepage 
                    allow users to scan through important information regarding the bakery easily. I chose to put most of the individual products and their little Description
                    in grid form such that look much more organised:

                        Once the wireframes for the desktop version was done, I did a mobile version for the website to show

                <h3 class="title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Usability Testing and Finding</h3>
                <p>
                    With the low-fidelity prototype, I decided to conduct the first usability testing to gather some
                    feedbacks from my friends and family to improve
                    the user experience and needs. The prototype showcases the main flow of the app which is purchasing
                    a craft supply.
                </p>
                <p>These are the tasks and question that the users had to complete during the testing:</p>
                <span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">1</span>
                Find a way to view the products page
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">2</span>
                add a product to cart after customising
                <br><span

                View your cart and proceed to the checkout

                Complete the checkout process and confirm order
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">5</span>
                How do you find the checkout process?
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">6</span>
                Check the schedules for your upcoming orders 

                <p style="margin-top: 35px;">After the user testing, I retrieved all the answers from the interview
                    notes and subsequently categorising them based on the app's features and grouping together those
                    that exhibited similar responses.Here are my finding to help improve the
                    crafTy app:</p>
                <span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large;">1</span>
                    Users prefer fulfilment date calendar selector instead of typing it
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">2</span>
                    “select the appropriate time of delivery” is confusing for users to understand
                <br><span
                    style="padding: 0 8px; text-align:center;border-radius: 15px;background-color:#954A05;color:#fff;font-size: large; ">3</span>
                    For the my orders page, the upcoming orders is not obvious enough
